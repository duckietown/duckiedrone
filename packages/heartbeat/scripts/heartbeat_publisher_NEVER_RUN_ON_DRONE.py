#The hearbeat that this node publishes is a signal to the drone that
#you can still make contact with the drone. therefore in order for this to work
#the heartbeat must be transmitted over the same channels that the commands are sent through.

#this is to replace the dependance on the web interface. 


#IMPORTANT 
#This
#should be run on the laptop you are using to control the drone. 
#Never on the drone itself.
