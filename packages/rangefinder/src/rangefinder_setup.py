#The purpose of this script:

#this script allows us to determine which rangefinder
#hardware is on board and then takes the steps to 
#configure it if needed.

#because each of the 4 sensors is identical, they each 
#start with the same i2c address. In order to fix this
#they must be given new addresses, however since the 
#sensors are all wired to the same connections changing
#one address would change all the others as well
#and we would have the same problem. To get arround this
#there is a special shutdown pin that we have wired to
#a different gpio for each of the sensors so what we do
#is shutdown all but one and sent the remap command
#then we shut down two of the remaining three and send
#the remap command, then one of the remaining two,
# then we remap the remaing one.
